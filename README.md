## Dataset
[**RarePlanes**](https://www.cosmiqworks.org/rareplanes/) is a unique open-source machine learning dataset from CosmiQ Works and AI.Reverie that incorporates both real and synthetically generated satellite imagery. The dataset consists of 253 Maxar WorldView-3 satellite scenes spanning 112 locations and 2,142 km^2 with 14,700 hand-annotated aircraft.

In this project, we only used the real images (~3 GB) for aircraft keypoint detection.
